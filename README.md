### My personal deep learning projects

This repository contains projects related to deep learning. In these projects, I have tried to demonstrate everything I have learned.

1. [CIFAR-10 Image classification using simple CNN and MobileNetV2](https://github.com/AlirezaHanifi/My-Journey-into-Deep-Learning/tree/master/1-%20CIFAR-10%20Image%20classification%20using%20simple%20CNN%20and%20MobileNetV2):</br>
**Aim of the project**: image classification using CNN models.</br>
**Project Description**: At first, we attempted to classify the images using a simple CNN model. However, the CNN model had many avoidable biases. The challenge is solved by increasing the model size and by changing the model architecture. Therefore, the pre-trained MobileNetV2 was used. Consequently, the change in the model architecture significantly reduced avoidable bias. A better result can also be obtained by increasing the number of epochs or by starting training from the basic layers of the MobileNetV2 model.</br></br>
2. [Car License Plate Detection](https://github.com/AlirezaHanifi/My-Journey-into-Deep-Learning/tree/master/2-%20Car%20License%20Plate%20Detection):</br>
**Aim of the project**: Car License Plate Detection.</br>
**Project Description**: Because of the small number of data, the pre-trained Xception model was used, but the results were not satisfactory. In the future, and to advance the work, a better metric and loss should be found for training models. The Yolo object detection model is another option.</br></br>
